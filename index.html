        <h2>2011</h2>
        <p>Mark Teixeira hit 39 home runs with 111 RBI, and C.J. Wilson struck out 206 batters as Frank's team edged out the Onionheads and Siberian Express. 
            <br>The title was Frank's first since joining the league in 1992, and coincided with the Cardinals' 11th World Series championship. <br>Joel Hanrahan saved 39 games,
            and the team survived the preseason loss of Adam Wainwright with an arm injury.  &#9918
