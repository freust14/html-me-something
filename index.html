        <h2>2011</h2>
        <p>Mark Teixeira hit 39 home runs with 111 RBI, and C.J. Wilson struck out 206 batters as Frank's team edged out the Onionheads and Siberian Express. 
            The title was Frank's first since joining the league in 1992, and coincided with the Cardinals' 11th World Series championship. Joel Hanrahan saved 39 games,
            and the team survived the preseason loss of Adam Wainwright with an arm injury.
